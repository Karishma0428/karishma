    <h1>What is Front-End-Devleopment?</h1>
    <p>
      Front-end web development, also known as client-side development is the
      practice of producing<span style="color:darkblue"> HTML, CSS and JavaScript</span> for a website or Web
      Application so that a user can see and interact with them directly.</br> The
      challenge associated with front end development is that the tools and
      techniques used to create the front end of a website change constantly and
      so the developer needs to constantly be aware of how the field is
      developing.</br>The objective of designing a site is to ensure that when the users open up the site they see the information in a format that is easy to read and relevant. </br></br>This is further complicated by the fact that users now use a large variety of devices with varying screen sizes and resolutions thus forcing the designer to take into consideration these aspects when designing the site.</br> They need to ensure that their site comes up correctly in different browsers (cross-browser), different operating systems (cross-platform) and different devices (cross-device), which requires careful planning on the side of the developer.
